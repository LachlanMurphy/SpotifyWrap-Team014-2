        -> Created getTrack function that takes in song ID 
        -> Updated search.hbs with handlebars in order to collect user input and display information about the given song
            -> Needs to be converted into a function that takes in song name rather than song ID (Cody's function 11/12 is working towards this solution)
        -> Adapted Cody's getArtist (solution 1) function by changing a couple lines of code and making it render search page with an artist object as opposed to .json object
            -> Updated handlebars in search.hbs to collect user input in a separate search bar for artists and display
            -> You can now search by name for any spotify artist and it will display the returned name and profile picture of that artist
