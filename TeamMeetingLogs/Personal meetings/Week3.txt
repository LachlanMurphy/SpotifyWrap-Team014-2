11/12/24 
- In person (before TA meeting)
- Discussed commits that we all made throughout the week and planned for this upcoming week
    -Cole
        ->
    -Josh
        ->
    -Gavin
        -> Created getTrack function that takes in song ID 
        -> Updated search.hbs with handlebars in order to collect user input and display information about the given song
            -> Needs to be converted into a function that takes in song name rather than song ID (Cody's function 11/12 is working towards this solution)
        -> Adapted Cody's getArtist (solution 1) function by changing a couple lines of code and making it render search page with an artist object as opposed to .json object
            -> Updated handlebars in search.hbs to collect user input in a separate search bar for artists and display
            -> You can now search by name for any spotify artist and it will display the returned name and profile picture of that artist
    -Cody
        -> Wrote two possible solutions to getArtist since we could not find out how to get artists ID which is needed to search for artist. Gavin then
        integrated this function so we could search artists and return them.
        -> Wrote a potential solution to our searchSong issue. Right now we can only get songs by ID which users don't know. I have almost figured out
        how to get the song ID to search for the song.
    -Lachlan
        -> Added messages to each page so if an event occurs (log in, register, etc) there is a message sent
        -> Fixed bugs in the index.js file so that the database is consitently working.
        -> Added user sessions to each page so a user is logged in when they are in the home page
           When logged in they can click on thier username and go to a page ot edit thier profile.
    -Brady
        -> Created edit profile page and have been working on a way to have user information from the login show up on profile page.
